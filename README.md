<h3>BuildTools</h3>
<p>
BuildTools is a basic building companion similar to WorldEdit, but designed in a different way.
BuildTools is based around simple block breaking and placing as opposed to a selection tool and 
commands.

Compiling currently requires the latest Bukkit, WorldGuard, GriefPrevention and PlotMe. The plugins 
are required for stopping players from building in protected areas using this plugin.</p>
